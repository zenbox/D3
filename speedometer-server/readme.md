# Using The Speedometer Server

The speedometer server is written in nodejs and must be started manually. On my Mac:

```bash
$ cd whereever-the-server-script-is/htdocs/speedometer-server/
$ node server

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
a http server runs on port 1337,
press strg-c to stop it.
